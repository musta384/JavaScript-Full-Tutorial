    <h2>Combining multiple promises</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, you need all the promises to be fulfilled, but they don't depend on each other. In a case like that,
      it's
      much more efficient to start them all off together, then be notified when they have all fulfilled. The
      <strong>Promise.all()</strong>
      method is what you need here. It takes an array of promises and returns a single promise.
    </p>
    <p>The promise returned by Promise.all() is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>fulfilled</strong> when and if all the promises in the array are fulfilled. In this case, the then()
        handler is called
        with an
        array of all the responses, in the same order that the promises were passed into all().
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>rejected</strong> when and if any of the promises in the array are rejected. In this case, the catch()
        handler is called
        with the
        error thrown by the promise that rejected.
      </li>
    </ul>
